# SQL Injection Demonstration

This repository contains code that demonstrates the concept of SQL Injection, a common security vulnerability in applications interacting with a database.

## What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's database query handling. Attackers use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on a database, potentially exposing sensitive data or manipulating the database.

### Example of SQL Injection:
A basic example is bypassing authentication with this input:

```sql
' OR '1'='1
#It also involves ways to prevent SQL Injection 

Hope this helps :)
